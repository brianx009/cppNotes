///Example 1: This example is to show that strings are passed by value, just as the previous one was in Lesson 3. We could see that we create a struct/class of a person, which we then make use of inside of int main as we create a Person object with the name "Brian", then we call the function updateName that is meant to modify the object person that we have created. It does so successfully inside of the function updateName, but when we go back into int main, because it was passed by value, it will not update the original object, it will only modify it inside of the function, resulting in the ./a.out to print out Brian twice instead of Brian and then updateName Brian. Another very interesting thing to note is when you run this program in gdb, when you get to updateName function inside of int main and then step into it, it takes us to the struct vs the updateName function. But if we think about it, this further helps us understand that it is bieng passed by value and not reference. That function call literally creates another Person object to work on, then updates the name. This is the behavior we would expect from somehting that is being passed by value vs reference.

struct Person{
  string name;     //member variable
  
  Person(string n): name(n) {}
};

void updateName(Person person);     //signature for function updateName

int main(){
  Person person("Brian");     // Object person created and initializing name to string

  cout << "Persons name is: " << person.name << endl;     //becasue person is a object (not a pointer to a object), and name is a member variable (not a member function), we call it with the ._memberVariable_ notation

  updateName(person);     //calling updateName function by passing in person as a value, not a reference

  cout << "Persons name after updateName is: " << person.name << endl;     //prints out Brian again, BOOOOOO THAT STINKS
  
  return 0;
}

void updateName(Person person){
  person.name = "updateName Brian";     //this will only update the object inside of this function, not anywhere else.
}
